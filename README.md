# fuzzy-flatpak

## Make some flatpak commands accept fuzzy names

## Description

reasoning
feedback / contributions welcome?
readme only dependency flatpak
how to use: call this sh (maybe chmod) or copy this file into ...
give instructions how to "install it locally for user / root / all"
also give instruction how to (partially) override flatpak with alias?
get to know find command and options, explain in readme?
worst case write entire name always find. if results wrong write more
chars and get more precise



features

make run and kill accept multiple programs? (run will create insane
output) also: if multiple input fail all on one or per case?

reverse kill: kill all but [these]

install script user

man page

display live preview per keystroke in input / like auto complete! :O

interactive like rm -i for run and kill with user input y/n (hard to do
with multiple names) output what was found and wait for descision.
