# fuzzy-flatpak

description
reasoning
feedback / contributions welcome?
readme only dependency flatpak
readme option to run it detached or in this terminal with & (tested, it works as expected)
if yes give readme: block this terminal or run detached, but still with A LOT of output
how to use: call this sh (maybe chmod) or copy this file into ...
give instructions how to "install it locally for user / root / all"
also give instruction how to (partially) override flatpak with alias?
get to know find command and options, explain in readme?
worst case write entire name always find. if results wrong write more chars and get more precise
