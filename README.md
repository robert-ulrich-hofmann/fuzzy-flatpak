# WIP: fuzzy-flatpak

## Description

This application enables the user to use certain flatpak commands without
searching for / knowing / having to use the typical three-part identifier.
Instead fuzzy-flatpak will "fuzzy search" for this identifier based on the
given input.

## Installation

Upcomming: Installer!

Describe what Installer does, steps to do manually.

## Usage

- readme only dependency flatpak and bash and also standard setup (location of flatpak $HOME/.var/app/)
- have not tested how supersets of bash (e.g. zsh) behave with it
- how to use: call this sh (maybe chmod) or copy this file into ...
- worst case write entire name always find. if results wrong write more chars and get more precise
- option to "run &" is preserverd and works as expected / like in plain flatpak
